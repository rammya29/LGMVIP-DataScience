## About LGM

LETSGROWMORE is a community of diverse people coming together with similar objectives and ultimate goals. 
LETS GROW MORE deep downed its roots at the very beginning of this year as a result of an idea that was brought up to be real by the Founder of LETSGROWMORE - AMAN KESARWANI.

LETSGROWMORE is all about creating opportunities for leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering of shared interests. 
They develop enriching environments and experiences that promote students' knowledge and wellbeing.

Their goal is to help others to gain personal and professional skills in technical and non-technical areas. 
The purpose is to provide a structure through which students may exercise their right to freely associate in pursuit of a common purpose or goal.
